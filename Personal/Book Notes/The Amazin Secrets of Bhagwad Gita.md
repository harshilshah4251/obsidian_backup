#### The Book in 3 Sentences
- The 3 tenets of Hinduism are perform karma without attachment to results (Nishkama karma or selfless actions), dissolve desire to dissipate ego, and controlling senses.
- Addresses concepts of what Hinduism says about women, homosexuality, heaven/hell, salvation, food, meditation, caste system etc.
#### Impressions
- I find Hinduism to be extremely liberal religion the more I read about it. Lord Krishna says that Arjuna can accept or refuse anything and everything the Lord Krishna says and still call himself a Hindu. 
- Hinduism encourages everyone to ask questions without judgment. Hinduism is for everyone and it respects all religions.
- The author says that in Manu Smriti, its written that women should be submissive, belong to lower birth, must be taken care of by father, husband, son etc. This is demeaning and it reflected the prevailing ideas of that time which are no longer relevant. Hinduism allows space for evolution of concepts. 
- Similarly, caste system was designed to delegate work in a newly formed civilization. Over time, it got degenerated and became a mechanism to discriminate against people. It's no longer relevant and hinduism allows space for that change as well.
